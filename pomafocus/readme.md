PomaFocus

Introduction:

    The goal of PomaFocus is to help user to be more productive. To achieve this, the PomaFocus helps user to adapt Pomodoro technique easily by scheduling and rescheduling the tasks for user, providing proper reminders and monitoring the status of tasks. A user would be able to input the projects he/she is working on, weigh them by importance, and break them each down into smaller tasks. PomaFocus will manage scheduling of tasks, notifications, and approximate timing to completion. The tool will be integrated with Google calendar, which will allow it to schedule tasks around existing meetings. Each task wonâ€™t necessarily be complete within 25 minutes, thus, the tool will make sure to keep track of how many pomodoros (25 minute intervals) it took to complete the task. Eventually Pomodoro will learn the users pattern and help user to predict how long similar tasks will take in the future and schedule future tasks based on the learning from past performance of user.
